## Development Methodology Report
#### The Arkan Project will be developed using an iterative software development methodology model. This is due to the fact that our group is not experienced enough to know how much time and effort will be required for each individual task and the fact that the outline for our game, including each individual task needed to develop our game, is flexible and is expected to change overtime. Additionally, our project is not conducive to an incremental development methodology like the waterfall model because our project’s requirements will likely evolve with time, and are not set in stone. With an iterative development model, our team can change things that do not comply with recent additions to our project, while an incremental development methodology like the waterfall model does not allow for such changes. We can coordinate “cycles” of development with an iterative development model that can include changing things that we have already created in earlier cycles of development. The Arkan Project’s team will not have to conform to a strict guideline and process outlined at the beginning of the production process under this model, and the general framework for our project is fluid enough that an incremental development model is not viable.

## Character Plan
#### Our main character is approximently 26 years old, 6 foot 1, and has a deep connection to the military haveing been a loyal soldier in the marine corps since he was 18. He was on a recoverary mission to find any survivors of a recent military plane crash but his helicopter was attacked by some sort of huge vine and He fell into a canyon. His mission is now to survive and ideally kill all creatures like the one that took down his helicopter. This mission should not be to difficult however because he is a trained survival expert and is always combat ready, this makes him one of the best in his trade when paired with his IQ of 115.
