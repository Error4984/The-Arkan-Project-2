## Development Methodology Report
# Pre-Production phase
#### The Arkan Project will be developed using an iterative software development methodology model. This is due to the fact that our group is not experienced enough to know how much time and effort will be required for each individual task and the fact that the outline for our game, including each individual task needed to develop our game, is flexible and is expected to change overtime. Additionally, our project is not conducive to an incremental development methodology like the waterfall model because our project’s requirements will likely evolve with time, and are not set in stone. With an iterative development model, our team can change things that do not comply with recent additions to our project, while an incremental development methodology like the waterfall model does not allow for such changes. We can coordinate “cycles” of development with an iterative development model that can include changing things that we have already created in earlier cycles of development. The Arkan Project’s team will not have to conform to a strict guideline and process outlined at the beginning of the production process under this model, and the general framework for our project is fluid enough that an incremental development model is not viable.

## Character Plan
#### Our main character is approximently 26 years old, 6 foot 1, and has a deep connection to the military haveing been a loyal soldier in the marine corps since he was 18. He was on a recoverary mission to find any survivors of a recent military plane crash but his helicopter was attacked by some sort of huge vine and He fell into a canyon. His mission is now to survive and ideally kill all creatures like the one that took down his helicopter. This mission should not be to difficult however because he is a trained survival expert and is always combat ready, this makes him one of the best in his trade when paired with his IQ of 115.

## Script

Log #064 
We finally got funding for our project on what the boss likes to call “The Arkan Project” which is designed to be a biological weapon that is to be used on the rebels, a biological weapon meaning a living breathing force to create mass destruction. Hopefully this war can end soon and we can stop losing people to the war. I don't know how buying out a company for 12 million dollars counts as a “company expense” but the boss says it's extremely important, so much so that it came out of his pockets. Too bad we had to wait this long for the government to green light our project. Well anyway I'll keep you guys updated Anderson out.

Julius has not been acting like himself recently. He seems incredibly worried about something but he’s good enough at covering things up but no one seems to notice. I mean I get that the Arkan Project is a bit scary when you really think about it but is it really something we need to be afraid of?

Log #206
The day of the first test is upon us brothers today we know if we win or lose. Ok we’re firing it up (light static) oh my god it's moving. IT’S MOVING YES!!! (BANG BANG BANG) …maybe a little too much, definitely too much, SHUT THIS THING DOWN! Sir we can't, the tranquilizers aren't having an effect. Keep your guns trained on it and hopefully it doesn't break out.


## Game Goals
Much of the game will have the player exploring. The goal of doing this is to acquire resources and find new locations. With the resources they can upgrade their weapons and other things and the new locations will be like levels. They will find entrances to “dungeons” that will have a variety of enemies and a boss in them. The overall goal is to complete all dungeons and kill the final boss in the final dungeon. 

## Engine Selection

We decided to use Unity. This is because it is free and still very versatile. It gives us a physics engine to work with and many other features that will improve our game. For the mechanics, the player will be moving around with WASD and looking around with the mouse. You can sprint and jump to get over terrain. Other mechanics will be collecting resources and using them to upgrade items. You will also be able to explore and enter dungeons with enemies to kill and a boss.
