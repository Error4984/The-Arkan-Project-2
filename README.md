#### **PLACEHOLDER DESCRIPTION/SUMMARY OF GAME**
# Development Planning and Management
## Development Methodology Report
#### The Arkan Project will be developed using an iterative software development methodology model. This is due to the fact that our group is not experienced enough to know how much time and effort will be required for each individual task and the fact that the outline for our game, including each individual task needed to develop our game, is flexible and is expected to change overtime. Additionally, our project is not conducive to an incremental development methodology like the waterfall model because our project’s requirements will likely evolve with time, and are not set in stone. With an iterative development model, our team can change things that do not comply with recent additions to our project, while an incremental development methodology like the waterfall model does not allow for such changes. We can coordinate “cycles” of development with an iterative development model that can include changing things that we have already created in earlier cycles of development. The Arkan Project’s team will not have to conform to a strict guideline and process outlined at the beginning of the production process under this model, and the general framework for our project is fluid enough that an incremental development model is not viable.
